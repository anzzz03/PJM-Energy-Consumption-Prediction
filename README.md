# PJM-Energy-Consumption-Prediction
This is a Time Series Forecasting project which makes use of XGBoost, an optimized distributed gradient boosting library designed for efficient and scalable training of machine learning models, which uses the PJM Hourly Energy Consumption Dataset to make predictions about the estimated energy consumption in Megawatts (MW) across several eastern US States such as Delaware, Illinois, Tennessee etc. between the years 2015 - 2018 by the creation of several features such as hour, day of the week, quarter, month, year and day of the year. We also calculate the root of mean squared error of the model on the Test Set as well as the Top 5 Best and Worst predicted days.
