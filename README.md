# PJM-Energy-Consumption-Prediction
This is a Time Series Forecasting project created using XGBoost, an optimized distributed gradient boosting library designed for efficient and scalable training of machine learning models, which uses the PJM Hourly Energy Consumption dataset to make predictions about the energy consumption in Megawatts (MW) across eastern U.S. states like Delaware, Illinois, and Tennessee from 2015 to 2018. Engineered key features such as hour, day of the week, quarter, month, and year to improve model performance. I also evaluated model accuracy by calculating the root mean squared error (RMSE) on the test set and identified the top 5 best and worst predicted days.
